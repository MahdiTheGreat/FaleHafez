The purpose of this project is to build a simple fortune-telling program. In this program, when entering, there is an option at the bottom of the screen to get a horoscope.

By pressing it, one of the five Hafez poems available in the program is randomly selected and displayed to the user.

The user can get another fortune by pressing that button again. 



Also, next to the fortune-telling button, there is another button named "About" that provides general information about the program, such as the version number and its author.
